This state-transition Markov analytic model is to assess the cost-effectiveness of extending biennial mammography for 
breast cancer screening from age 75 to 80 by race (i.e., non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic 
American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN), Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API)).
